# LLM Wiki Compiler

## What This Is

A personal knowledge management system where LLM agents incrementally build and maintain a persistent, interlinked Obsidian wiki from raw source documents. Instead of re-deriving knowledge from scratch on every query (like RAG), the LLM compiles sources into structured wiki pages — summaries, entity pages, concept pages, comparisons — and keeps them current as new sources arrive. The human curates sources and asks questions; the LLM does all the bookkeeping.

## Core Value

The wiki is a persistent, compounding artifact — cross-references are already there, contradictions already flagged, synthesis already reflects everything ingested. Knowledge accumulates rather than being re-derived.

## Requirements

### Validated

- [x] Agent-agnostic schema (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) that tells any LLM how to maintain the wiki — Validated in Phase 01: schema-structure-conventions
- [x] Directory structure conventions for raw sources, wiki pages, index, and log — Validated in Phase 01: schema-structure-conventions
- [x] Typed page schemas: entity pages, concept pages, source summaries, comparisons, with type-specific templates — Validated in Phase 01: schema-structure-conventions
- [x] Structured operations layer: UPDATE, MERGE, SUPERSEDE, ARCHIVE instead of raw file rewrites — Validated in Phase 01: schema-structure-conventions
- [x] Progressive disclosure: shallow summaries for navigation, drill-down for detail — Validated in Phase 01: schema-structure-conventions
- [x] Obsidian integration: graph view compatibility, Dataview frontmatter, Marp slide generation, wikilinks — Validated in Phase 01: schema-structure-conventions
- [x] Page type templates for entity, concept, source summary, comparison, and overview — Validated in Phase 02: page-types-examples-navigation
- [x] Epistemic status markers: sourced, inferred, tentative, stale — inline syntax and documentation — Validated in Phase 02: page-types-examples-navigation
- [x] Example wiki pages demonstrating all conventions and page types — Validated in Phase 02: page-types-examples-navigation
- [x] Index system: content-oriented catalog with categories, summaries, metadata — Validated in Phase 02: page-types-examples-navigation
- [x] Log system: chronological, parseable, append-only activity record — Validated in Phase 02: page-types-examples-navigation

### Active
- [ ] Ingest workflow: source classification, extraction, multi-page wiki updates, provenance tracking
- [ ] Query workflow: index-first search, synthesis with citations, delta compilation back into wiki
- [ ] Lint workflow: contradiction detection, stale claims, orphan pages, missing cross-references, data gaps
- [ ] Reflect workflow: decision records, structural reasoning, reframing history
- [ ] Claim-level provenance: which sources support which claims, freshness tracking
- [ ] Compilation pipeline: diff → extract → merge → lint, with optional follow-on passes
- [ ] CLI helpers for common operations (search, ingest, lint)
- [ ] Cross-system drift detection between wiki, raw sources, and any external tools

### Out of Scope

- Building a hosted web application — this is a local, file-based system
- Embedding-based RAG infrastructure — index-first search is the v1 approach
- Multi-user collaboration features — this is a personal system
- Non-markdown output formats — markdown + Obsidian is the stack
- Mobile apps — desktop Obsidian + CLI agents only
- OAuth/auth — no authentication layer needed for a local system

## Context

The idea draws from Vannevar Bush's Memex (1945) — a personal, curated knowledge store with associative trails. The key insight is that LLMs eliminate the maintenance burden that causes humans to abandon wikis. The human's job is curation and thinking; the LLM handles summarizing, cross-referencing, filing, and consistency.

The system has three layers:
1. **Raw sources** — immutable input documents (articles, papers, images, journal entries, etc.)
2. **The wiki** — LLM-generated and maintained markdown pages (the compiled artifact)
3. **The schema** — the configuration document (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) that governs LLM behavior

The first domain will be personal knowledge — goals, health, psychology, self-improvement, journal entries, articles, podcast notes. Obsidian is the primary browsing interface. The system must work with multiple LLM agents (Claude Code, Codex, others).

The v1 is a full starter kit: schema, workflows, conventions, page templates, example pages, index/log templates, and CLI helpers — everything needed to clone and start using immediately. The v2 (future) will be software that automates the compilation pipeline.

## Constraints

- **Agent-agnostic**: Schema must work with Claude Code (CLAUDE.md), Codex (AGENTS.md), and other agents — no agent-specific features in the core conventions
- **File-based**: Everything is markdown files in a git repo — no databases, no servers, no cloud dependencies for v1
- **Obsidian-first**: Wiki pages must be valid Obsidian markdown — wikilinks, frontmatter, graph-compatible structure
- **Local-only**: All data stays on disk — no external API calls required for core wiki operations (LLM calls are the exception)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Guide/template first, software tool second | Get the pattern right through personal use before automating | — Pending |
| Personal/self as first domain | Concrete use case to validate against, high personal motivation | — Pending |
| Full framework from v1 (provenance, epistemic status, structured ops) | The advanced features are what differentiate this from "LLM writes notes" | — Pending |
| Obsidian as primary interface | Graph view, Dataview, Marp, plugin ecosystem — best-in-class for interlinked markdown | — Pending |
| Agent-agnostic design | Avoid lock-in, test with multiple agents to find what works | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
