# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** The wiki is a persistent, compounding artifact -- cross-references are already there, contradictions already flagged, synthesis already reflects everything ingested.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — ingestion-provenance-pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (ingestion-provenance-pipeline) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 5

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 95 v1 requirements (standard granularity)
- Roadmap: CLI helpers distributed across phases 3-5 where their functionality is most relevant
- Roadmap: Epistemic status placed in Phase 2 (with templates) per research advice that it's foundational to trustworthiness
- [Phase 01]: Source registry uses frontmatter on wiki/sources/ pages (Dataview-native)
- [Phase 01]: snake_case for all frontmatter fields; 16 base fields including aliases
- [Phase 01]: Extended provenance syntax with optional support type and checked_at for staleness
- [Phase 01]: Pipeline vs. workflow separation: conceptual model (Section 10) vs. operator procedures (Section 11)
- [Phase 01]: Privacy conflict resolution: stricter setting always wins (local_only over cloud_safe)
- [Phase 01]: Mandatory query write-back: novel synthesis must be compiled back into wiki
- [Phase 01]: All 19 Phase 1 requirements pass automated validation including YAML parse, structural, provenance syntax, and content checks
- [Phase 02]: Templates use empty/default values rather than placeholder text to prevent accidental publication
- [Phase 02]: FORBIDDEN PATTERNS block placed between frontmatter and first section for maximum agent visibility
- [Phase 02]: Concept page is natural home for tentative/stale markers due to genuine debates in bias research
- [Phase 02]: Overview pages use mixed epistemic_status as standard pattern for synthesis pages
- [Phase 02]: Inferred markers include qualifying language to make epistemic reasoning explicit
- [Phase 02]: Log ordering follows AGENTS.md section 12 (newest at bottom) as authoritative spec
- [Phase 03]: CLI ingest helper (bin/ingest.sh) handles file bookkeeping only — zero LLM/API calls per D-11/D-13
- [Phase 03]: UTC dates used for source directory paths to guarantee determinism across operator timezones
- [Phase 03]: Source ingest collisions require --force to overwrite; empty slugs rejected with clear error
- [Phase 03]: book-chapter is the canonical source type for book content; full books ingested as chapter sequence
- [Phase 03]: Claim granularity follows smallest-unit-that-preserves-provenance heuristic, source-type driven
- [Phase 03]: Incremental updates use append-then-synthesize: append detail, re-synthesize summary, supersede explicitly
- [Phase 03]: Stale/supersede wording deliberately softened to defer formal contradiction semantics to Phase 5

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 3 (ingest prompts) and Phase 5 (contradiction detection) as areas needing empirical iteration
- REQUIREMENTS.md stated 70 requirements but actual count is 95 -- traceability section corrected
