# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** The wiki is a persistent, compounding artifact -- cross-references are already there, contradictions already flagged, synthesis already reflects everything ingested.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — page-types-examples-navigation

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 95 v1 requirements (standard granularity)
- Roadmap: CLI helpers distributed across phases 3-5 where their functionality is most relevant
- Roadmap: Epistemic status placed in Phase 2 (with templates) per research advice that it's foundational to trustworthiness
- [Phase 01]: Source registry uses frontmatter on wiki/sources/ pages (Dataview-native)
- [Phase 01]: snake_case for all frontmatter fields; 16 base fields including aliases
- [Phase 01]: Extended provenance syntax with optional support type and checked_at for staleness
- [Phase 01]: Pipeline vs. workflow separation: conceptual model (Section 10) vs. operator procedures (Section 11)
- [Phase 01]: Privacy conflict resolution: stricter setting always wins (local_only over cloud_safe)
- [Phase 01]: Mandatory query write-back: novel synthesis must be compiled back into wiki
- [Phase 01]: All 19 Phase 1 requirements pass automated validation including YAML parse, structural, provenance syntax, and content checks

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 3 (ingest prompts) and Phase 5 (contradiction detection) as areas needing empirical iteration
- REQUIREMENTS.md stated 70 requirements but actual count is 95 -- traceability section corrected
